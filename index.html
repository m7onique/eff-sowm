                <p>My maternal grandmother, Lilia Limon was my greatest spiritual
                    influence of my youth. Every time I turned around she seemed
                    to be in prayer. At the sink washing dishes, behind the stove
                    cooking, on the altar at church, or at the park kneeling at a
                    table in the pavilion. These are some of my favorite memories
                    of her that taught me the necessity of prayer in every situation.
                    "I remember your genuine faith, for you share the faith that
                    first filled your grandmother Lois and your mother, Eunice.
                    And I know that same faith continues strong in you."
                    II Timothy 1:5 NIV </p>

                <p>The most significant miracle of my youth involved my mother. In
                    the early 1990's she was diagnosed with cancer and required a bone
                    marrow transplant to live. I was 10 yrs old and couldn't concieve of
                    life without her. It was during this difficult time that my
                    grandfather introduced me to Christ and handed me a Bible and told
                    me to read it daily. I discovered scripture passages about healing
                    and immediately began to pray earnestly for God to heal my mother.
                    In God's miraculous mercy he healed my mother of cancer and allowed
                    her to live until she was sixty-four. I beleive this miracle was more
                    for me than it was for my mother, as it solidified my faith
                    and was the genesis of a life-long relationship with Him.

            <h1>Apologetic Mom</h1>

            <p>"When the Pharisees criticized him for these accusations, Jesus made no apology.
                On the contrary, he implied the Pharisees were in trouble because they thought themselves
                too good for such company. This was Jesus' persistent criticism of his beloved Israel. they had
                developed a pessimistically
                separatist outlook on the world. They had become a family that only socialized with family
                because the neighborhood had become too dangerous. They had become like Christians who attend
                Christian schools not because they value a Christian education, but because they fear
                thecontamination
                of non-Christians."

            <p>When Manny and I married alomost nine years ago, I had no idea what
                it would be like to be a musician's wife. I didn't possess any musical talent,
                nor did I understand what recording a song involved.
