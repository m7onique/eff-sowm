                <p>My maternal grandmother, Lilia Limon was my greatest spiritual
                    influence of my youth. Every time I turned around she seemed
                    to be in prayer. At the sink washing dishes, behind the stove
                    cooking, on the altar at church, or at the park kneeling at a
                    table in the pavilion. These are some of my favorite memories
                    of her that taught me the necessity of prayer in every situation.
                    "I remember your genuine faith, for you share the faith that
                    first filled your grandmother Lois and your mother, Eunice.
                    And I know that same faith continues strong in you."
                    II Timothy 1:5 NIV </p>

                <p>The most significant miracle of my youth involved my mother. In
                    the early 1990's she was diagnosed with cancer and required a bone
                    marrow transplant to live. I was 10 yrs old and couldn't concieve of
                    life without her. It was during this difficult time that my
                    grandfather introduced me to Christ and handed me a Bible and told
                    me to read it daily. I discovered scripture passages about healing
                    and immediately began to pray earnestly for God to heal my mother.
                    In God's miraculous mercy he healed my mother of cancer and allowed
                    her to live until she was sixty-four. I believe this miracle was more
                    for me than it was for my mother, as it solidified my faith
                    and was the genesis of a life-long relationship with Him.
                    James 5:14-15; (NIV) "14 Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the
                    elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the
                    name of the Lord. 15 And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick
                    person well; the Lord will raise them up. If they have sinned, they will
                    be forgiven."

            <p> It can be so difficult to stand on your beliefs when you may not know
                how to find facts and information outside of university classes. I absolutely
                love the approach authors: J. Scott Duvall and J. Daniel Hayes take in their book,
                Grasping God's Word. In an effort to better understand the Bible, the authors ask
                the reader to take the biblical text through five steps. 1-Grasp the text in their
                town. What did the text mean to the original audience? 2-Measure the width of the
                river to cross. What are the differences between the biblical audience and us?
                3-Cross the priniciplizing bridge. What is the theological principle in this text?
                4-Consult the biblical map. How does our theological principle fit with the rest
                of the Bible? 5-Grasp the text in our town. How should individual Christians today
                live out the theological principles?
            <p>It is important to investigate the unknown ourselves and find clarity concerning
                the biblical text. How can I help in this pursuit? Go to the contact-me page and
                send me a message.

            <h1>Marriage and Music</h1>
            <img class="picflow" src="photos/m&m worship summit/slide-1.jpg" alt="monique and manny">
            <p> When Manny and I married alomost nine years ago, I had no idea what
                it would be like to be a musician's wife. In our first year of marriage,
                we went on a "Vision Retreat" where we prayed and discussed what the next year would
                hold concerning our family, finances, ministries, etc. We QUARRLED over the financing
                of his music projects because I didn't understand concepts like "mastering" and "instrument
                tracks: drums, horns, keys," etc. I'm thinking: Mastering-I'm getting my masters, can I
                master it? Beats-Can't we get synth beats on our casio keyboard? Why we gotta pay separately
                for these things and why does it take so long before I see a finished product?</p>
            <p>
                Many of you who are musicians are probably getting a good chuckle out of this, but
                it's all true! I literally had to seek God on my knees and surrender this issue to Him.
                After a month or two of continued prayer, God pressed upon my heart that music was not
                a HOBBY but a MINISTRY for Manny. Once I understood this revelation then I grasped the
                vision and passion of Manny's heart for worship and made it a part of me. I know my
                husband is called to the nations to annouce God's prescence with his trumpet and to make
                the theology of music plain for artists and musicians so that they may produce effectual worship.
