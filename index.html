                <p>My maternal grandmother, Lilia Limon was my greatest spiritual
                    influence of my youth. Every time I turned around she seemed
                    to be in prayer. At the sink washing dishes, behind the stove
                    cooking, or at the church altar. These are some of my favorite memories
                    of her that taught me the necessity of prayer in every situation.
                    "I remember your genuine faith, for you share the faith that
                    first filled your grandmother Lois and your mother, Eunice.
                    And I know that same faith continues strong in you."

                    height="100">
                <p>There's this song: "I have decided to follow Jesus....
                    the cross before me the world behind me....no turning back,
                    no turning back!" I often sang this song with hopeful determination
                    of a steadfast Christian walk. I'd say, this time God it's gonna be
                    different!! However, most times I chose sin over holiness and fell into
                    despair and depression because I felt I had "turned back to the world."
                    Although, I had many intimate encounters and miracle experiences with God,
                    I was stuck in a cycle of works for grace. My prayers included disclaimers:
                    "God I know you may not answer my prayer because I didn't tithe, go to service,
                    or read the Bible, etc. My obedience & perseverance failed in my human frailty.
                    However, God would rescue me from a pit of depression with a revelation from His
                    Word. </p>
                <p> 2 Corinthians 10:3-6 (TPT) "3-4 For although we live in the natural realm,
                    we donâ€™t wage a military campaign employing human weapons, using manipulation to
                    achieve our aims. Instead, our spiritual weapons are energized with divine power
                    to effectively dismantle the defenses behind which people hide. 5 We can demolish
                    every deceptive fantasy that opposes God and break through every arrogant attitude
                    that is raised up in defiance of the true knowledge of God. We capture, like prisoners
                    of war, every thought and insist that it bow in obedience to the Anointed One.
                    6 Since we are armed with such dynamic weaponry, we stand ready to punish any trace
                    of rebellion, as soon as you choose complete obedience."</p>

            <p> It can be so difficult to stand on your beliefs when you may not know
                how to find facts and information outside of university classes. I absolutely
                love the approach authors: J. Scott Duvall and J. Daniel Hayes take in their book,
                Grasping God's Word. In an effort to better understand the Bible, the authors ask
                the reader to take the biblical text through five steps. 1-Grasp the text in their
                town. What did the text mean to the original audience? 2-Measure the width of the
                river to cross. What are the differences between the biblical audience and us?
                3-Cross the priniciplizing bridge. What is the theological principle in this text?
                4-Consult the biblical map. How does our theological principle fit with the rest
                of the Bible? 5-Grasp the text in our town. How should individual Christians today
                live out the theological principles?
            <p>It is important to investigate the unknown ourselves and find clarity concerning
                the biblical text. How can I help in this pursuit? Go to the contact-me page and
                send me a message.

            <h1>Marriage and Music</h1>
            <img class="picflow" src="photos/m&m worship summit/slide-1.jpg" alt="monique and manny">
            <p> When Manny and I married almost nine years ago, I had no idea what
                it would be like to be a musician's wife. In our first year of marriage,
                we went on a "Vision Retreat" where we prayed and discussed what the next year would
                hold concerning our family, finances, ministries, etc. We QUARRLED over the financing
                of his music projects because I didn't understand concepts like "mastering" and "instrument
                tracks: drums, horns, keys," etc. I'm thinking: Mastering-I'm getting my masters, can I
                master it? Beats-Can't we get synth beats on our casio keyboard? Why we gotta pay separately
                for these things and why does it take so long before I see a finished product?</p>
            <p>
                Many of you who are musicians are probably getting a good chuckle out of this, but
                it's all true! I literally had to seek God on my knees and surrender this issue to Him.
                After a month or two of continued prayer, God pressed upon my heart that music was not
                a HOBBY but a MINISTRY for Manny. Once I understood this revelation then I grasped the
                vision and passion of Manny's heart for worship and made it a part of me. I know my
                husband is called to the nations to announce God's prescence with his trumpet and to make
                the theology of music plain for artists and musicians so that they may produce effectual worship.
