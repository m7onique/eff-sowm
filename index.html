        <p>My maternal grandmother, Lilia Limon was my greatest spiritual influence
            of my youth. Every time I turned around she seemed to be in prayer. At
            the sink washing dishes, behind the stove cooking, on the altar at
            church, or at the park kneeling at a table in the pavilion. These are
            some of my favorite memories of her that taught me the necessity of prayer
            in every situation. </p>

        <p>The most significant miracle of my youth involved my mother.
            I cried tears of desperation for God to heal my mother as I feared
            what would happen if He didn’t. About six months later, a
            "healing evangelist" was holding a service at my grandfather's church
            and I begged my mother to attend as I was positive God was going to
            heal her. She reluctantly agreed and went to the service.

        <p>When Manny and I married alomost nine years ago, I had no idea what
            it would be like to be a musician's wife. I didn't possess any musical talent,
            nor did I understand what recording a song involved.
