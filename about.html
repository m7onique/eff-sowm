                <p>Over the years I have acquired a myriad of skills relating to problem solving and management,
                    not only in the professional sector, but also in various ministerial positions. My resume
                    reveals the demands of income and has allowed for greater diversity in skill sets; however,
                    the opportinuty to combine my professional skills and faith is the ultimate goal.</p>
                <p> In the last 10 years, my pursuits have become more faith centered as I realized how fulfilled
                    and happy it makes me. I have incredible zeal and passion for causes I believe in, especially
                    my faith, and I now know this is what I want to do full-time. Until this full-time passion becomes
                    my sole source of income, I must endeavor to create other streams of income that will help this
                    dream be realized.</p>

                        <h2>Testimony</h2>
                        <p>There's this song: "I have decided to follow Jesus....
                            the cross before me the world behind me....no turning back,
                            no turning back!" I often sang this song with hopeful determination
                            of a steadfast Christian walk. I'd say, this time God it's gonna be
                            different!! However, most times I chose sin over holiness and fell into
                            despair and depression because I felt I had "turned back to the world."
                            Although, I had many intimate encounters and miracle experiences with God,
                            I was stuck in a cycle of works for grace. My prayers included disclaimers,
                            "God I know you may not answer my prayer because I didn't tithe, go to service,
                            or read the Bible, etc. My obedience & perseverance failed in my human frailty.
                            However, God would rescue me from a pit of depression with a revelation of His
                            through his Word. </p>

                            <p>With my husband Manuel D. Rodriguez, we have founded The School of the Worshiping
                                Musician. This school has been a dream for my husband to help artists and musicians
                                understand the theology of their artistry and muscianship. Although, I do not possess
                                any musical talent, I absolutely consider myself a worshiper and am excited to be a
                                part of this effectual worship initiative.

                            <p>Marriage Today with Jimmy and Karen Evans has had such a meaningful impact in our
                                marriage and family life. We ascribe to a biblical view of marriage with God as the
                                foundation and the lense in which we see our roles and purpose within the family unit.
                                The videos and books found in the Marriage on the Rock series are invaluable tools in
                                helping couples and families navigate the spiritual necessities of a true Marriage on
                                the Rock. Manny and I are certified teachers for this curriculum and enjoy helping other
                                couples as they journey with us to strengthen their marriages.
