                <p>Over the years I have acquired a myriad of skills relating to problem solving and management,
                    not only in the professional sector, but also in various ministerial positions. Working with
                    people in any capacity requires interpersonal skills in order to communicate effectively and
                    accomplish mutual goals. I often utilize a "drill down" process for projects to find its
                    particular function and designed outcome for stakeholders and users. Helping a team work
                    together and coordinating workflow has been a part of almost every position I've worked in.</p>
                <p>
                    As a more mature person in the work place, I have the added value of life experience and
                    "old school" grit and perseverance to draw out potential in processes and people. My
                    ultimate professional desire is to be able to combine my skills and faith in one satisfying
                    career.
                    My resume reveals the demands of income and has allowed for greater diversity in skill sets. I
                    consider myself a life-long learner and will continue to seek out new opportunities where this
                    combination of my profession and faith can be realized.

                            <p>With my husband Manuel D. Rodriguez, we have founded The School of the Worshiping
                                Musician.
                                This
                                school has been a dream for my husband to help artists and musicians understand the
                                theology
                                of their artistry and muscianship. Although, I do not possess any musical talent, I
                                absolutely
                                consider myself a worshiper. As believers, we are called to lay down our lives and
                                embrace
                                the comission of reconciling the lost to Jesus and this requires a lifestyle of
                                worship unto to Him.

                            <p>Marriage Today with Jimmy and Karen Evans has had such a meaningful impact in our
                                marriage
                                and family life. We ascribe to a biblical view of marriage with God as the foundation
                                and the lense in which we see our roles and purpose within the family unit. The videos
                                and books found in the Marriage on the Rock series are invaluable tools in helping
                                couples and families navigate the spiritual necessities of a true Marriage on the Rock.
                                Manny and I are certified teachers for this curriculum and enjoy helping other couples
                                as they journey with us to strengthen their marriages.
