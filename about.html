                During the last 20 years, I have had the pleasure of serving in multiple ministries as Women's
                Leader, Ministry Coordinator, Small Group Leader, and various other positions. My passion lies in
                teaching the bible and making God's message known to all who desire it. My salvation journey began with
                anger, resentment, and challenges to God to make himself real in my desparate situation. He answered
                these challenges with love and compassion, and miracles that only He could do. My desire in this life
                is to simply be a catalyst for radical change in other's lives with the saving power of Jesus
                Christ.</p>

                        <p>With my husband Manuel D. Rodriguez, we have founded The School of the Worshiping Musician.
                            This
                            school has been a dream for my husband to help artists and musicians understand the theology
                            of their artistry and muscianship. Although, I do not possess any musical talent, I
                            absolutely
                            consider myself a worshiper. As believers, we are called to lay down our lives and embrace
                            the comission of reconciling the lost to Jesus and this requires a lifestyle of
                            worship unto to Him.

                        <p>Marriage Today with Jimmy and Karen Evans has had such a meaningful impact on marriage
                            and family life. We ascribe to a biblical view of marriage with God as the foundation
                            and the lense in which we see our roles and purpose within the family unit. The videos
                            and books found in the Marriage on the Rock series are invaluable tools in helping
                            couples and families navigate the spiritual necessities of a true Marriage on the Rock.
                            Manny and I are certified teachers for this curriculum and enjoy helping other couples
                            as they journey with us to strengthen their marriages.

            <p>Over the years I have acquired a myriad of skills relating to problem solving and management,
                not only in the professional sector, but also in various ministerial positions. Working with
                people in any capacity requires interpersonal skills in order to communicate effectively and
                accomplish mutual goals. I often utilize a "drill down" process for projects to find its
                particular function and designed outcome for stakeholders and users. Helping a team work
                together and coordinating workflow has been a part of almost every position I've worked in.</p>
            <p>
                As a more mature person in the work place, I have the added value of life experience and
                "old school" grit and perseverance to draw out potential in processes and people. My
                ultimate professional desire is to be able to combine my skills and faith in one satisfying career.
                My resume reveals the demands of income and has allowed for greater diversity in skill sets. I
                consider myself a life-long learner and will continue to seek out new opportunities where this
                combination of my profession and faith can be realized.
