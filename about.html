                        <h2>Family and Church</h2>
                        <p>I was born in upstate New York, but moved to San Antonio, Texas when my parents
                            divorced. I lived in Texas for most of my life and recently moved to Bountiful,
                            Utah in 2019 to be near my sister.
                        </p>
                        <p>I'm married to Manuel D. Rodriguez and have 2 beautiful children; Isabel and Eli.</p>
                        <p>We currently attend New Creation Church in Sandy, Utah and absolutely love it.

                <p>Over the years I have acquired a myriad of skills relating to problem solving and management,
                    not only in the professional sector, but also in various ministerial positions. My resume
                    reveals the demands of income and has allowed for greater diversity in skill sets; however,
                    the opportinuty to combine my professional skills and faith is the ultimate goal.</p>
                <p> In the last 10 years, my pursuits have become more faith-centered as I realized how fulfilled
                    and happy it makes me. I have incredible zeal and passion for causes I believe in, especially
                    my faith, and I now know this is what I want to do full-time. Until this full-time passion becomes
                    my sole source of income, I must endeavor to create other streams of income that will help this
                    dream be realized.</p>

                            <p>The most significant miracle of my youth involved my mother. In
                                the early 1990's she was diagnosed with cancer and required a bone
                                marrow transplant to live. I was 10 yrs old and couldn't concieve of
                                life without her. It was during this difficult time that my
                                grandfather introduced me to Christ and handed me a Bible and told
                                me to read it daily. I discovered scripture passages about healing
                                and immediately began to pray earnestly for God to heal my mother.
                                In God's miraculous mercy he healed my mother of cancer and allowed
                                her to live until she was sixty-four. I believe this miracle was more
                                for me than it was for my mother, as it solidified my faith
                                and was the genesis of a life-long relationship with Him.
                                James 5:14-15; (NIV) "14 Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the
                                elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the
                                name of the Lord. 15 And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick
                                person well; the Lord will raise them up. If they have sinned, they will
                                be forgiven."

                            <p>With my husband Manuel D. Rodriguez, we have founded The School of the Worshiping
                                Musician. This school has been a dream for my husband to help artists and musicians
                                understand the theology of their artistry and muscianship. Although, I do not
                                possess
                                any musical talent, I absolutely consider myself a worshiper and am excited to be a
                                part of this effectual worship initiative.

                            <p>Marriage Today with Jimmy and Karen Evans has had such a meaningful impact in our
                                marriage and family life. We ascribe to a biblical view of marriage with God as the
                                foundation and the lense in which we see our roles and purpose within the family
                                unit.
                                The videos and books found in the Marriage on the Rock series are invaluable tools
                                in
                                helping couples and families navigate the spiritual necessities of a true Marriage
